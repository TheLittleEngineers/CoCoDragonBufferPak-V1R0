# CoCoDragonBufferPak-V1R0
A simple buffer pack for the CoCo/Dragon/Clones. All signals are buffered except for the 5V and 12V Supplies, SND and SLENB*. Designed by: "The R.A.T." May 21, 2019. LICENSE: CC BY-SA 4.0. I decided that, if I was going to be plugging untested prototypes into my CoCo, I needed to provide at least some protection against frying the poor thing. This is the result of that "protection effort".
